# Smart Motors
## A trainable motor for storytelling
Smart Motors aim to lower the barriers of entry into robotics. By lowering the cost and shifting the paradigm from programming a robot to training a robot we aim to make robotics accessible to beginners as well as for teachers who want to introduce robotics in their classrooms.

In response to the challenge of how does one bring robotics into a classroom with limited computers/WiFi, we started to play around with the idea of a trainable motor.   What if, for $10, you could get a motor that can learn from you?  Can you combine that with cardboard, glue, and tape to build robots without needing a computer?  What if you had a computer, what further opportunities would that open up? We are exploring on how this might work in a local school, at scale.  In particular, we are thinking this could link nicely into the Novel Engineering work, allowing students to animate their inventions with a smart motor or a smart light or smart speaker.

# Smart Motor Prototype
## Earlier stages of Smart Motor prototype
We explore the technical possiblilities of Smart Motor in this video. We are using Seeeduino Xiao and Grove sensors. The code is written in Circuit Python, a python variant for microprocessors by Adafruit.
