# SymbIOTics
##  an IoT Platform Designed for Elementary School Classrooms

SymbIOTics is an Internet of Things platform designed for elementary school students. It was developed as an undergraduate senior honors thesis as a way to introduce elementary school students to the Internet of Things by allowing them to build their own smart connected products.

## The System
SymbIOTics system consists of three main components:
1. a smart brick containing a Wio Node (small wifi enabled microprocessor) and battery,
2. Grove sensor/actuator modules, and
3. the LabVIEW Dashboard creation interface.

*SymbIOTics Smart Brick and its Exploded View*



The smart brick houses all of the system's intelligence in a LEGO Compatible 3D printed casing with a laser-cut bottom. To enable students to easily turn on and off the smart brick, the battery wires are routed through two neodymium magnets. A small magnetic bumper with two magnets connected by a wire acts as a switch to turn on and off the bricks. The Grove sensors are all attached to laser-cut acrylic LEGO mounts, which allows students to easily integrate them directly into their LEGO creations.

Students can control their actuators, monitor sensor values, and write rules for their system using the drag and drop dashboard interface on LabVIEW. Since the SymbIOTics system is designed for students ages 7 and up, coding interface is made as simple as possible. Students simply select the Grove sensor or actuator module they want to add to the dashboard from the SymbIOTics palette, and drop it onto their dashboard. From there they can move the object around and change different controls as desired. All user-controlled components of the interface are either drop-down menus, clickable buttons, or numeric controls, eliminating the need for students to write text-based code. Students can also drag and drop “Rules” modules onto their dashboard, which allows them to create a correlation between a sensor and an actuator.


## Tests

*Example Zoo Exhibits Built With SymbIOTics System TEST*

The system was tested in a 2nd grade coding classroom. Students were challenged to build an Internet of Things zoo. After incorporating sensors and actuators into their own zoo exhibits, they began to leverage the power of a network of devices to build dashboards that enabled a zoo keeper to access information about all of the zoo exhibits in the class. The results showed that second grade students were easily able to understand the main idea behind the Internet of Things and use the benefits of connected devices to build more complex systems than they would have been able to build without an internet connection. Of the fourteen students who tested the platform, every student successfully built their own IoT artifact, and eleven students were able build their own IoT system as well as interact with their classmates’ systems in a meaningful way. The solution diversity and important peer-to-peer discussions sparked by the use of the new platform illustrated both the technical viability of the new technology and the important learning outcomes generated by enabling students to create their own smart connected products.
