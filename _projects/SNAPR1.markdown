# SNAPR -  Snap, Narrate, Auto Post and Reflect

SNAPR is a tool that lets students capture and populate their e-portfolios automatically. In making/engineering, there is an emphasis on the final product and the ‘in-between’ stages are often ignored. SNAPR helps students reflect on the ‘in-between’ stages and encourage them to share stories of the processes that led to the final product.

SNAPR is a tool designed for a design-based research study based on the conjecture:

*In a making activity, e-portfolios provide observable opportunities for students to reflect on intermediate steps in their making, while also providing observable evidence for facilitators to assess students’ learning.*

We plan to explore the following research questions:

1. What processes of making are evident in students’ e-portfolio?
2. How can SNAPR encourage student reflection in the processes of making?
3. How are students’ STEM literacies represented in the e-portfolio, and how does enacting those practices contribute to their evolving identity as an engineer or a maker?

Similar to Canvas, there are various e-portfolio platforms that students can use to showcase their work. Unfortunately, most of them are designed in such a way that the users usually update the content only after their work is complete. Likewise, most people find it cumbersome to document their work, as they are working on a project. We think, opportunities for reflection on the ‘in-between’ stages are missing in the existing design of e-portfolios.

In order to minimize this limitation, we designed SNAPR which lets the students automatically populate their e-portfolios while they are working on their projects. The setup constitutes a camera, connected to the WiFi, which periodically takes snapshots of the student work and uploads the snapshots to the students’ e-portfolios. Once populated, the students can access the uploaded snapshots to choose which ones to keep on their e-portfolio, perhaps to tell a story of failure, or to highlight an ‘Aha’ moment, or to share an insight they had about how their learning evolved.
