  <p>Backpacks are hardware extensions for SPIKE Prime. You can connect your SPIKE Prime to the internet using Pyboard Backpack, connect to a wide range of Grove Sensors using Grove Sensor Backpack and build machine vision projects using OpenMV Backpack. Explore all 6 backpacks we have built for SPIKE Prime.</p>

  <p><img src="AIforSPIKEPrime/MorseCodeDetector/morsecodedetector.jpg" alt="Link to my pic" class="small" /></p>

  <p>The robot uses machine learning to figure out, for the length you held down the button, whether it is equivalent do a dot or a dash in morse code! But what if it’s wrong? It has a built in feature to tell it that it’s wrong. This will make it guess more accurately for later presses!</p>
