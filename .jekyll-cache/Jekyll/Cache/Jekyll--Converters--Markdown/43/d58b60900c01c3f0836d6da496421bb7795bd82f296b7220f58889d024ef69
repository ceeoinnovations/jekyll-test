  <p>Smart Motors aim to lower the barriers of entry into robotics. By lowering the cost and shifting the paradigm from programming a robot to training a robot we aim to make robotics accessible to beginners as well as for teachers who want to introduce robotics in their classrooms.</p>

  <p>In response to the challenge of how does one bring robotics into a classroom with limited computers/WiFi, we started to play around with the idea of a trainable motor.   What if, for $10, you could get a motor that can learn from you?  Can you combine that with cardboard, glue, and tape to build robots without needing a computer?  What if you had a computer, what further opportunities would that open up? We are exploring on how this might work in a local school, at scale.  In particular, we are thinking this could link nicely into the Novel Engineering work, allowing students to animate their inventions with a smart motor or a smart light or smart speaker.</p>

  <p>We explore the technical possiblilities of Smart Motor in this video. We are using Seeeduino Xiao and Grove sensors. The code is written in Circuit Python, a python variant for microprocessors by Adafruit.</p>
