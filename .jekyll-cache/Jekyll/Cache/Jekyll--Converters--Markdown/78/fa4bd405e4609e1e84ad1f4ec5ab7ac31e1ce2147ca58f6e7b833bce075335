  <p>Hello friend,</p>

  <p>Welcome to the journey!</p>

  <p>First things first - Click on the Github link above (under the project name) to go the Github page. Find and <b>duplicate</b> the sample.markdown file. <b>Rename</b> it with suitable name. Create a folder with the same name (not necessary, but very important!!) inside <b>projects_assests folder</b>. Remember markdown file outside projects_assets folder, and project folder inside the projects_assets folder.</p>

  <p>As soon as you do this your page should be created on ceeoinnovations.github.io which you can access by going to https://www.ceeoinnovations.github.io/projects/&lt;projectname&gt;.html</p>

  <h2 id="lets-begin">Letâ€™s begin</h2>

  <p>Open the markdown file in your favorite text editor. (Caution!! Do not edit the sample file, edit the duplicate file!!)</p>

  <p>What you see on the top between â€” and â€”  is the front matter. Carefully edit the tags. Items like legal, linker, linkname are optional. Use them according to need!</p>

  <p>Here are things that you can use!</p>
