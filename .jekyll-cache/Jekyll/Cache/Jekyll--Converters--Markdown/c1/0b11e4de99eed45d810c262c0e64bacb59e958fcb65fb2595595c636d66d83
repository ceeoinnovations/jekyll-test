  <h2 id="kit-development">Kit Development</h2>
  <p>The development of the kit involved specking out a building system, creating a custom printed circuit board and other custom laser-cut/3D printed mounts. An extruded aluminum build system called MakerBeam was selected as the foundation of the kit.Â This kit was designed to be all-encompassing such that students could quickly and easily build simple robots using the myRIO. However, it was also designed with the idea of students manufacturing their own custom parts to create more complicated builds.</p>
